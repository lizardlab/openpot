# OpenPot
OpenPot is a replacement to the Instant Pot Smart Bluetooth Low Energy app that was taken off the App and Play Markets. OpenPot tries to mimic as closely as possible the layout (with some minor improvements) of the original app. It supports all cooking function, telemetry reporting (temperature, pressure level, heating, etc.), timer adjustment, and changing all the parameters for doing cooking. The only thing this version does not do is the "recipe mode" which involves a state machine and I felt was too complicated for the amount of time I wanted to spend on this project.

## Using OpenPot
Open the main page and click the blue "Connect" button. When the top icon turns white. Then you can select any of the functions and start your Instant Pot wirelessly! This app should be compatible with the newest version of Android, which is version 16 at the time of this writing.

## BLE Protocol
To make this as "future proof" as possible the reverse engineered protocol is detailed below. The 2 main packets we are concerned with are both 20-byte long, and one handles operating the Instant Pot "command packet" while the other gives details on how the cook is coming along "telemetry packet". Also for full customization, there is a time service which the Timer 1, Timer 2, 24 hour clock, and time setting can be both obtained and written to.

### UUIDs

#### Work Mode

### Time
The time is a 32 bit (big endian) timestamp with a custom epoch of 2001-01-01T00:00:00 in the current timezone. Example would be 2024-10-17T12:00:00 would become `B025C12C`. Can be written and read to 0xdaa1.

The 24 hr is a simple 1 bit value. It is 1 if it is 24 hour time, 0 if it is 12 hour time. Write/Read this value to 0xdaa4

Timers are similarly H:M in BCD format. They are also supplied in the command packet. Timer 1 is 0xdaa2 and Timer 2 is 0xdaa3 and both can be written and read.
